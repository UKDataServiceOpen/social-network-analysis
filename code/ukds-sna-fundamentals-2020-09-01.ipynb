    "### What is Social Network Analysis (SNA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Schneider, 2008). A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Key point that needs to be said somewhere - does it go in the principles section?*]\"That is, the network analyst is always interested in how the individual is embedded within a structure and how the structure emerges from the micro-relations between individual parts.\" (7 of PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "It originated from *network theory* - a branch of *graph theory* - which seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017). As a result of these origins, SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will provide a clear, concise guide to these concepts and terms, as well as introduce you to social network data. "

    "### What are the principles behind SNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Borgatti et al. (2002) establish five key principles of SNA:\n",
    "1. *SNA focuses on relations (connections) between actors.* Actors and their relations are seen as interdependent rather than independent units.\n",
    "2. *The relations between actors are the most meaningful focus of analysis.* Your data may allow you to perform other types of analyses - e.g., how does income vary across individuals and is it associated with variation in subjective wellbeing? - but the focus of SNA is on examining and understanding how actors are connected e.g., to what extent are individuals connected and are these patterns associated with income and subjective wellbeing? Put another way, the central concern of analytical concern is the relation, not the individual.\n",
    "3. *The structural and/or relational features of these actors constitute the analytically relevant characteristics of them.* To quote Freeman (2006, p. #):\n",
    ">...these patterns [interactions between people] are important features of the lives of the individuals who display them.\n",
    "4. *Relational ties between these actors are the channels for the flow of both material and non-material resources*. In essence, the connections are important and offer opportunities for sharing of valuable resources.\n",
    "5. *The complete web of actors, their positions and their linkages - the network structure - provides opportunities for (and constraints upon) action.* This is one of the most important points to remember: networks are not only constructed from the relations between actors, they in turn influence the behaviour, opportunities, contraints and outcomes of said actors. We'll reflect on some of the mechanisms through which networks affect outcomes at the micro level in a later lesson [LINK]().\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this focus on relational rather than attributional aspects of the units of analysis that makes SNA distinct as a methodology (Caiani, 2014)."

    "### Why should you consider SNA for your research?\n",
    "\n",
    "From an analytical perspective, SNA can be employed for a variety of valuable purposes (Caiani, 2014; Owen-Smith, 2017):\n",
    "* The social phenomenon of interest is a network i.e., it is the unit of analysis in your research project. For example, a researcher may be interested in analysing the London Underground rail network (like in this [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018)).\n",
    "* The features and properties of a network can be important explanatory factors ('right-hand side' variables) for understanding other social phenomena. For example, in a review of the impact of social networks on health outcomes, Smith and Christakis (2008, p. 420) conclude that:\n",
    ">  illness, disability, health behaviors, health care use, and death in one person are associated with similar outcomes in numerous others to whom that person is tied, and there can be a nonbiological transmission of illness."

    "\n",
    "The entities that are connected in a network are known as **nodes**, a term derived from network theory. Nodes can be individuals, organisations, countries, animals, events, computers, train stations etc. We could also refer to entities as *actors* or *agents* - which are terms specific to SNA -, or *vertices* - which is a term used in geometry -, or *points*, which is used in graph theory. For consistency, we will use the term **node**.\n",

    "[*Talk about direct and indirect ties, strong and weak ties*]\n",
    "\n",
    "Connections or relations between entities are known as **ties**. Other terms include *edges* (network theory), *lines* (graph theory), or *links*. There are a multitude of different types of ties: for example, a family tree contains ties between brothers and sisters, nieces and uncles, children and parents etc. Two individuals can also be related in multiple ways: for example, a pair of colleagues may also be good friends, part of the same sports club, and have attended the same university. As stated previously, it is therefore crucial to clearly define which ties you are interested in measuring, and acknowledging that your data are most likely a sample of **all** possible ties that exist between your nodes (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many measurement scales we can use to measure ties (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005):\n",
    "* Nominal or Binary: presence or absence of a relation\n",
    "* Multinomial: type of relation e.g., friend, colleague etc - usually transformed into binary.\n",
    "* Ordinal (grouped): likert scale of relation strength or frequency e.g., on a scale of 1-5 (1 = weak, 5 = strong), classify the relationship you have with each family member.\n",
    "* Ordinal (full-rank): rank nodes in order of relation e.g., best friend, second best friend.\n",
    "* Interval: numerical scores assigned to relations e.g., relations between charities and funders, valued by how much funding is provided. It is possible to switch from interval to binary by specifying a threshold or cut point.\n",
    "\n",
    "However many methods and measures of analysis focus on ties measured on a *binary* or *interval* scale, and thus we focus on these throughout the rest of this and future lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a ties as possessing two dimensions (Scott, 2017):\n",
    "1. Numeration / Strength:\n",
    "    * Binary: a tie exists between two entities\n",
    "    * Valued: a tie can be assigned a value representing greater / lesser importance, strength, prominence etc. (This corresponds to the interval measurement scale)\n",
    "2. Directionality:\n",
    "    * Directed: the tie flows from one entity to another (and is potentially reciprocated); put another way, the relation has a *source node* and *target node*. For example, an individual (source) donates money to a charity (target).\n",
    "    * Undirected: the tie does not originate from or terminate at a particular node e.g., if John is married to Jane, Jane must be married to John. Therefore an undirected tie *symmetric* or *reciprical* by default. It is also possible to treat directed ties as undirected: for example, I am sharing this lesson with you, therefore a connection exists between us.\n",

For example, individuals are nested within organisations, which are nested within industries, which are nested within countries etc. Individuals may have ties to people in a different organisation, while the organisation may also have ties with other organisations. Therefore using our understanding of nodes (entities) and ties (connections), we can identify different network modalities:\n",

A graph is a set of lines connecting points, and graph theory is a \"*body of mathematical axioms and formulae that describe the properties of the patterns formed by the lines.\"* (Scott, 2017: #). A basic example is below: this graph represents an network containing 5 nodes and 10 ties: the ties are binary, undirected and of the same type (often referred to as a **simple graph**)."
