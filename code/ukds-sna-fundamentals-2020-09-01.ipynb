    "### What is Social Network Analysis (SNA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Schneider, 2008). A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "SNA is heavily defined by contributions from *network theory* &mdash; a branch of *graph theory* &mdash; which seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017). As a result of these origins, SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis."

    "### What are the principles underpinning SNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Borgatti et al. (2002) establish five key principles of SNA:\n",
    "1. *SNA focuses on relations (connections) between actors.* Actors and their relations are seen as interdependent rather than independent units.\n",
    "2. *The relations between actors are the most meaningful focus of analysis.* Your data may allow you to perform other types of analyses &mdash; e.g., how does income vary across individuals and is it associated with variation in subjective wellbeing? &mdash; but the focus of SNA is on examining and understanding how actors are connected e.g., to what extent are individuals connected and are these patterns associated with income and subjective wellbeing? Put another way, the central concern of analytical concern is the relation, not the individual.\n",
    "3. *The structural and/or relational features of these actors constitute the analytically relevant characteristics of them.* To quote Freeman (2006, p. #):\n",
    ">...these patterns [interactions between people] are important features of the lives of the individuals who display them.\n",
    "4. *Relational ties between these actors are the channels for the flow of both material and non-material resources.* In essence, the connections are important and offer opportunities for sharing of valuable resources.\n",
    "5. *The complete web of actors, their positions and their linkages - the network structure - provides opportunities for (and constraints upon) action.* This is one of the most important points to remember: networks are not only constructed from the relations between actors, they in turn influence the behaviour, opportunities, contraints and outcomes of said actors. We'll reflect on some of the mechanisms through which networks affect outcomes at the micro level in a later lesson [ [LINK] ]().\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this focus on relational rather than attributional aspects of the units of analysis that makes SNA distinct as a methodology (Caiani, 2014)."

    "### Why should you consider SNA for your research?\n",

    "1. The social phenomenon of interest takes the form of a network i.e., it is thing you are trying to describe and explain in your research project. For example, a researcher may be interested in analysing the London Underground rail network (like in this [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018)). In such instances SNA provides a powerful and rich set of analytical tools for describing important features of networks."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "2. The features and properties of a network can be important explanatory factors ('right-hand side' or independent variables) for understanding other social phenomena. Recall a key feature of social networks elucidated in the above principles: network properties can explain patterns of action and processes of change for individuals/groups. Note also how network/structural properties map onto important concepts in social theories e.g., strong and weak ties (Granovetter, 1973), structural holes (Burt, 1992), social capital (Bourdieu, 1986) etc. \n",
    "For example, in a review of the impact of social networks on health outcomes, Smith and Christakis (2008, p. 420) conclude that:\n",
    ">  illness, disability, health behaviors, health care use, and death in one person are associated with similar outcomes in numerous others to whom that person is tied, and there can be a nonbiological transmission of illness."

    "* Analysing implications of these relations on outcomes experienced by units of analysis.\n",

    "2. Decide which units of analysis and types of relations to analyse i.e., who is connected and which relationships matter? \n",

This data set can include attributional data also: for example, Twitter data can provide information on which accounts follow each other (relational), as well as details about the accounts themselves (attributional).\n",

For consistency, we will use the term **node**.\n",

As stated previously, it is therefore crucial to clearly define which ties you are interested in measuring, and acknowledging that your data are most likely a sample of **all** possible ties that exist between your nodes (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005)."

    "2. **Directionality**:\n",
    "    * *Directed*: the tie flows from one entity to another (and is potentially reciprocated); put another way, the relation has a *source node* and *target node*. For example, an individual (source) donates money to a charity (target).\n",
