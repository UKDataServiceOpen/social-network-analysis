    "\n",
    "In this training series we cover some of the essential knowledge and skills needed to engage in **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**, a methodological approach that provides concepts, tools and techniques for uncovering and understanding social structures and relations. We focus on the three major aspects of SNA:\n",
    "1. Understanding fundamental concepts and terms [Focus of this notebook].\n",
    "2. Collecting, cleaning and repurposing data about social networks.\n",
    "3. Performing basic and intermediate analyses of social network data. \n",

    "By the end of these lessons you should be confident in your understanding of key SNA concepts and terms, proficient in the handling and cleaning of social network data, and able to apply a range of analytical techniques to derive substantive insight about social structures and relations. In addition, you will gain fluency in the use of the Python programming language for SNA and other computational social science tasks."

    "### What is Social Network Analysis (SNA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Caiani, 2014). A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "SNA is heavily defined by contributions from *network theory* &mdash; a branch of *graph theory* &mdash; which seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017). As a result of these origins, SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis."

For example, a researcher may be interested in analysing the London Underground rail network (like in this [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018)). In such instances SNA provides a powerful and rich set of analytical tools for describing important features of networks."

These properties and features can explain patterns of action, processes of change, and outcomes for individuals/groups (Scott, 2017). Note also how network/structural properties map onto important concepts in social theories e.g., strong and weak ties (Granovetter, 1973), structural holes (Burt, 1992), social capital (Bourdieu, 1986) etc. \n",

There are a multitude of different types of ties present in the social world e.g., family relations, friendships, event attendance, club memberships, communal living, collegial etc. And it is possible for two entities to be connected by many different types of ties: for example, a pair of colleagues may also be good friends, part of the same sports club, and have attended the same university. As stated previously, it is therefore crucial to clearly define which ties you are interested in measuring, and acknowledging that your data are most likely a sample of **all** possible ties that exist between your nodes (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005)."

    "Many people are familiar with the visual representation of networks, known as **graphs** (network theory) or **sociograms** (SNA). A graph is a set of lines connecting points, and graph theory is a \"*body of mathematical axioms and formulae that describe the properties of the patterns formed by the lines.\"* (Scott, 2017, p. 13). \n",

    "* Nodes are represented as circles\n",
    "* Ties are represented as lines (with arrow heads if the tie is directed)\n",
    "* Colours, shapes and sizes can be used to differentiate nodes by their attributes or network characteristics.\n",
    "* Colours, shapes and sizes can also be used to differentiate relations by their type or amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, **there is no inherent meaning or information conveyed by these features**. The fact that Steven Van Zandt is positioned closer to Max Weinberg than Bruce Springsteen on the graph does not say anything about the nature or strength of their ties. Likewise Garry Tallent could have been placed anywhere on the graph, it still would not change his status in the network as an isolate (i.e., he has no ties).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to imbue nodes and ties on a graph with meaning: for example, thicker lines can indicate the strength of the tie, different colours can distinguish nodes by an attribute (e.g., males and females).\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualising networks is an appealing activity, and there are some excellent examples (see [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/networks/)). However it is better to focus on the structure and numeric analysis of social network data, as they are more revealing about the patterns of connections in a network (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005)."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a broad, rich and increasingly relevant methodology for investigating patterns in social structures and relations. SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis. We hope this lesson has clarified some of these concepts, terms and distinctive data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck on your data-driven travels!"
