    "### What is Social Network Analysis (SNA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Caiani, 2014). A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "SNA is heavily defined by contributions from *network theory* &mdash; a branch of *graph theory* &mdash; which seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017). As a result of these origins, SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis."

    "1. The social phenomenon of interest takes the form of a network i.e., it is the thing you are trying to describe and explain in your research project. For example, a researcher may be interested in analysing the London Underground rail network (like in this [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018)). In such instances SNA provides a powerful and rich set of analytical tools for describing important features of networks."

These properties and features can explain patterns of action, processes of change, and outcomes for individuals/groups (Scott, 2017). Note also how network/structural properties map onto important concepts in social theories e.g., strong and weak ties (Granovetter, 1973), structural holes (Burt, 1992), social capital (Bourdieu, 1986) etc. \n",
    "For example, in a review of the impact of social networks on health outcomes, Smith and Christakis (2008, p. 420) conclude that:\n",

    "\n",
    "Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a broad, rich and increasingly relevant methodology for investigating patterns in social structures and relations. SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis. We hope this lesson has clarified some of these concepts, terms and distinctive data structures.\n",
