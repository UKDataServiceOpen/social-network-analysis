    "### What is Social Network Analysis (SNA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Schneider, 2008). A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "SNA is heavily defined by contributions from *network theory* &mdash; a branch of *graph theory* &mdash; which seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017). As a result of these origins, SNA is a highly technical and mathematical approach to sociological analysis, replete with an intimidating vocabularly of terms and concepts not otherwise encountered with other forms of social science research (Scott, 2017). In addition, the data underpinning SNA have a distinctive structure and thus require specialised approaches to data manipulation and analysis."

    "### What are the principles underpinning SNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Borgatti et al. (2002) establish five key principles of SNA:\n",
    "1. *SNA focuses on relations (connections) between actors.* Actors and their relations are seen as interdependent rather than independent units.\n",
    "2. *The relations between actors are the most meaningful focus of analysis.* Your data may allow you to perform other types of analyses &mdash; e.g., how does income vary across individuals and is it associated with variation in subjective wellbeing? &mdash; but the focus of SNA is on examining and understanding how actors are connected e.g., to what extent are individuals connected and are these patterns associated with income and subjective wellbeing? Put another way, the central concern of analytical concern is the relation, not the individual.\n",
    "3. *The structural and/or relational features of these actors constitute the analytically relevant characteristics of them.* To quote Freeman (2006, p. #):\n",
    ">...these patterns [interactions between people] are important features of the lives of the individuals who display them.\n",
    "4. *Relational ties between these actors are the channels for the flow of both material and non-material resources.* In essence, the connections are important and offer opportunities for sharing of valuable resources.\n",
    "5. *The complete web of actors, their positions and their linkages - the network structure - provides opportunities for (and constraints upon) action.* This is one of the most important points to remember: networks are not only constructed from the relations between actors, they in turn influence the behaviour, opportunities, contraints and outcomes of said actors. We'll reflect on some of the mechanisms through which networks affect outcomes at the micro level in a later lesson [ [LINK] ]().\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this focus on relational rather than attributional aspects of the units of analysis that makes SNA distinct as a methodology (Caiani, 2014)."

Note also how network/structural properties map onto important concepts in social theories e.g., strong and weak ties (Granovetter, 1973), structural holes (Burt, 1992), social capital (Bourdieu, 1986) etc. \n",
    "For example, in a review of the impact of social networks on health outcomes, Smith and Christakis (2008, p. 420) conclude that:\n",

Therefore a network is an aggregation or collection of these entities and their connections.

    "### Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "The entities included in a network are known as **nodes**, which is a term derived from network theory. Nodes can be individuals, organisations, countries, animals, events, computers, train stations etc. We could also refer to entities as *actors* or *agents* - which are terms specific to SNA -, or *vertices* - which is a term used in geometry -, or *points*, which is used in graph theory. For consistency, we will use the term **node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even adopting the term **node** still leaves plenty of room for differentiation: if there is a particular node you are interested in, it is often referred to as a **focal node** or **ego**. Nodes that are or could be connected to an ego are known as **alters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns of connections between nodes also give rise to further distinctions: two nodes that are or could be connected are called a **dyad**, while three nodes that are or could be connected are called a **triad**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see plenty of examples of each type of node in this training series, for now just familiarise yourself with the terminology and distinctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is worth posing the following questions about nodes in advance of your analysis:\n",
    "* Who are they and how many of them are there in a network?\n",
    "* What connections/ties exists between them?\n",
    "* What positions do they occupy in the network? For example, do they broker connections between other nodes?"

    "[*Talk about direct and indirect ties, strong and weak ties*]\n",
    "\n",
    "Connections or relations between entities are known as **ties**. Other terms include *edges* (network theory), *lines* (graph theory), or *links*. There are a multitude of different types of ties: for example, a family tree contains ties between brothers and sisters, nieces and uncles, children and parents etc. Two individuals can also be related in multiple ways: for example, a pair of colleagues may also be good friends, part of the same sports club, and have attended the same university. As stated previously, it is therefore crucial to clearly define which ties you are interested in measuring, and acknowledging that your data are most likely a sample of **all** possible ties that exist between your nodes (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many measurement scales we can use to measure ties (Hanneman & Riddle, 2005):\n",
    "* Nominal or Binary: presence or absence of a relation\n",
    "* Multinomial: type of relation e.g., friend, colleague etc - usually transformed into binary.\n",
    "* Ordinal (grouped): likert scale of relation strength or frequency e.g., on a scale of 1-5 (1 = weak, 5 = strong), classify the relationship you have with each family member.\n",
    "* Ordinal (full-rank): rank nodes in order of relation e.g., best friend, second best friend.\n",
