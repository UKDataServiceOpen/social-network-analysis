We focus on the three major stages of SNA:\n",
    "1. Understanding fundamental concepts and terms. [ [LINK] ](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/social-network-analysis/blob/master/code/ukds-sna-fundamentals-2020-09-01.ipynb)\n",

    "3. Performing basic and intermediate analyses of social network data. \n",

    "By the end of these lessons you should be confident in your understanding of key SNA concepts and terms, proficient in the handling and cleaning of social network data, and able to apply a range of analytical techniques to derive substantive insight about social structures and relations. In addition, you will gain fluency in the use of the Python programming language for SNA and other computational social science tasks."

    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Caiani, 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017)."

    "A network is constructed from two key components (Owen-Smith, 2017):\n",
    "1. The **entities** that are (or can be) connected.\n",
    "2. The **connections** that exist (or could exist) between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a family tree is a network containing individuals (entities) that are related through some type of familial tie (connection). Therefore a network is an aggregation or collection of these entities and their connections.
