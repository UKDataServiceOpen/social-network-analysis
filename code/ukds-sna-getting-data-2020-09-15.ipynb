    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of relational structures (Schneider, 2008). [*Talk more about what a relational structure is*] It requires distinctive data structures, methods of analysis and data visualisation techniques (Caiani, 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "Though various attempts have been made to establish a theoretical foundation for SNA...(Scott, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "It has evolved from *network theory*, which itself seeks to generate measurable representations of patterns of relationships between entities in an abstract or actual space (Owen-Smith, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *duality* of social networks: Networks are created by and influence the actions of entities. Related point: network structure is not always the result of deliberate action on the part of the entities i.e., their is no vision or strategy for the network, it simply arises through the many small decisions of the entities."

    "### What are the principles behind SNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Borgatti et al. (2002) establish five key principles of SNA:\n",
    "1. *SNA focuses on relations (connections) between actors.* Actors and their relations are seen as interdependent rather than independent units.\n",
    "2. *The relations between actors are the most meaningful focus of analysis.* Your data may allow you to perform other types of analyses - e.g., how does income vary across individuals and is it associated with variation in subjective wellbeing? - but the focus of SNA is on examining and understanding how actors are connected e.g., to what extent are individuals connected and are these patterns associated with income and subjective wellbeing? Put another way, the unit of analysis is the relation, not the individual.\n",
    "3. *The structural and/or relational features of these actors constitute the analytically relevant characteristics of them.* To quote Freeman (2006, p. #):\n",
    ">...these patterns [interactions between people] are important features of the lives of the individuals who display them.\n",
    "4. *Relational ties between these actors are the channels for the flow of both material and non-material resources*. In essence, the connections are important and offer opportunities for sharing of valuable resources.\n",
    "5. *The complete web of actors, their positions and their linkages - the network structure - provides opportunities for (and constraints upon) action.* This is one of the most important points to remember: networks are not only constructed from the relations between actors, they in turn influence the behaviour, opportunities, contraints and outcomes of said actors. We'll reflect on some of the mechanisms through which networks affect outcomes at the micro level in a later lesson [LINK]().\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this focus on relational rather than attributional aspects of the units of analysis that makes SNA distinct as a methodology (Caiani, 2014)."

    "### Why should you consider SNA for your research?\n",
    "\n",
    "From an analytical perspective, SNA can be employed for a variety of valuable purposes (Caiani, 2014; Owen-Smith, 2017):\n",
    "* The social phenomenon of interest is a network i.e., it is the unit of analysis in your research project. For example, a researcher may be interested in analysing the London Underground rail network (like in this [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018)).\n",
    "* The features and properties of a network can be important explanatory factors ('right-hand side' variables) for understanding other social phenomena. For example, in a review of the impact of social networks on health outcomes, Smith and Christakis (2008, p. 420) conclude that:\n",
    ">  illness, disability, health behaviors, health care use, and death in one person are associated with similar outcomes in numerous others to whom that person is tied, and there can be a nonbiological transmission of illness."

    "\n",
    "The entities that are connected in a network are known as **nodes**.

    "Connections or relations between entities are known as **ties**. There are a multitude of different types of ties: for example, a family tree contains ties between brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces and uncles, children and parents etc. Two individuals can also be related in multiple ways: for example, a pair of colleagues may also be good friends, part of the same sports club, and have attended the same university. \n",

    "\n",

Technically, a component is a set of nodes where every node is maximally connected: that is, each node is connected to every other node, either directly or indirectly. In addition, there are no connections with nodes outside the component (Scott, 2017).\n",

    "\n",
