    "In this training series we cover some of the essential knowledge and skills needed to engage in **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**, a methodological approach that provides concepts, tools and techniques for uncovering and understanding social structures, relations and networks of assocation. We focus on the three major stages of SNA:\n",
    "1. Understanding fundamental concepts and terms [ [LINK] ](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/social-network-analysis/blob/master/code/ukds-sna-fundamentals-2020-09-01.ipynb).\n",

    "3. Performing basic and intermediate analyses of social network data. [Focus of this notebook]\n",

    "By the end of these lessons you should be confident in your understanding of key SNA concepts and terms, proficient in the handling and cleaning of social network data, and able to apply a range of analytical techniques to derive substantive insight about social structures and relations. In addition, you will gain fluency in the use of the Python programming language for SNA and other computational social science tasks."

    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Caiani, 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. \n",
    "\n",

    "2. The **connections** that exist (or could exist) between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a family tree is a network containing individuals (entities) that are related through some type of familial tie (connection). Therefore a network is an aggregation or collection of these entities and their connections.
