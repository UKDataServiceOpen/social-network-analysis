    "Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. Thus, computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training series we cover some of the essential knowledge and skills needed to engage in **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**, a methodological approach that provides concepts, tools and techniques for uncovering and understanding social structures, relations and networks of assocation. We focus on the three major stages of SNA:\n",
    "1. Understanding fundamental concepts and terms [LINK].\n",
    "2. Collecting and cleaning social network data from various sources. [LINK]\n",
    "3. Performing basic and intermediate analyses of social network data. [Focus of this notebook]\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of these lessons you should be confident in your understanding of key SNA concepts and terms, proficient in the handling and cleaning of social network data, and able to apply a range of analytical techniques to derive substantive insight about social structures and relations. In addition, you will gain fluency in the use of the Python programming language for SNA and other computational social science tasks."
