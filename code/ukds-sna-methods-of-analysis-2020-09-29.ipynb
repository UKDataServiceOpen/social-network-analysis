    "Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. Thus, computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientist’s toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training series we cover some of the essential knowledge and skills needed to engage in **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**, a methodological approach that provides concepts, tools and techniques for uncovering and understanding social structures, relations and networks of assocation. We focus on the three major stages of SNA:\n",
    "1. Understanding fundamental concepts and terms [ [LINK] ](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/social-network-analysis/blob/master/code/ukds-sna-fundamentals-2020-09-01.ipynb).\n",
    "2. Collecting and cleaning social network data from various sources. [ [LINK] ](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/social-network-analysis/blob/master/code/ukds-sna-getting-data-2020-09-15.ipynb)\n",
    "3. Performing basic and intermediate analyses of social network data. [Focus of this notebook]\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of these lessons you should be confident in your understanding of key SNA concepts and terms, proficient in the handling and cleaning of social network data, and able to apply a range of analytical techniques to derive substantive insight about social structures and relations. In addition, you will gain fluency in the use of the Python programming language for SNA and other computational social science tasks."

    "\n",
    "Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodological and conceptual toolbox for the measurement, systematic description, and analysis of patterns in relational structures in the social world (Caiani, 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "A relation is a distinctive type of connection or tie between two entities (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For example, a married couple share a spousal relation, a brother and sister share a sibling relation, co-workers share a collegial relation etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relations are the building blocks of networks, and thus SNA is concerned with and most appropriate for analyses of data capturing relations between units of analysis (Scott, 2017)."

    "A network is constructed from two key components (Owen-Smith, 2017):\n",
    "1. The **entities** that are (or can be) connected.\n",
    "2. The **connections** that exist (or could exist) between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a family tree is a network containing individuals (entities) that are related through some type of familial tie (connection). Therefore a network is an aggregation or collection of these entities and their connections. For example, here is the familial network of the members of the UK Royal Family ([BBC, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-23272491\n",

    "To what extent are nodes in the network clustered together? That is, do groups of nodes tend to realise all possible connections between them. *Transitivity* is one such measure of clustering: it is defined as the ratio of all triads realised to all possible triads. A possible triad exists when one node is connected to two others: in such a scenario we can assume that the other two nodes have a good opportunity to connect to each other. Put another way, *transitivity* calculates the probability that two individuals who share a common acquaintance, will end up connecting with each other directly i.e., a friend of a friend becomes a friend. \n",
