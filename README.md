# Social Network Analysis

Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. Thus, computational methods for collecting, cleaning and analysing data are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit. Social Network Analysis (SNA) offers a rich and insightful methododolgical approach for uncovering and understanding social structures, relations and networks of assocation.

## Topics

The following topics are covered under this training series:
1. **Fundamental Concepts** - understand the fundamental concepts and terms underpinning social network analysis. 
2. **Getting and Marshalling Data** - learn how to collect and clean social network data.  
3. **Techniques and Methods of Analysis** - learn how to apply a range of analytical methods and techniques to derive substantive insights from social network data.

## Materials

The training materials - including webinar recordings, slides, and sample Python code - can be found in the following folders:
* [code](./code) - run and/or download code using our Jupyter notebook resources.
* [faq](./faq) - read through some of the frequently asked questions that are posed during our webinars.
* [installation](./installation) - view instructions for how to download and install Python and other packages necessary for working with new forms of data.
